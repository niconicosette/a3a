- do their slide out profiles (in dom)
- <div class="profilecardcontainer" id="guyprofile"> etc

- sort their images and add them to both rarity sort and chara sort (add (2) to title and act="2" and page ="theirname")
- <img class="thumb" src="img/tsumugi/r-angel2.png" cardname="天使を憐れむ歌。(1)" page="tsumugi" act="1">

- add their event sounds to dom sound spans
- <span class="nosho" id="omisakuyabday2" sound="sound/zsakuyabday2/omi.mp3" msg="..."></span> etc

- fix their birthday dates in ifevent function
     else if ( xday == 92 &&  xmonth == 92 ) {

      } etc...
