<p>Entered card testing mode.</p>

<p>Testing cards is very simple! Go to the card tab, sort by character, and decide a character to test cards for. Select a card, make sure the full image displays correctly, set the card to your page and test that the transparent image displays correctly and you hear the correct character voice. Then repeat these steps for each card of that character.</p>

<p>If a card seems to be taking forever to load, try refreshing and clicking on it again. If it still doesn't load, the file is probably missing so please report it in the a3a-dev channel.</p>

<p>If you notice any sorting mistakes, like an SR card sandwiched between R cards, please report that, too!</p>

<p>Below is a list of characters whose cards are fully tested.</p>
