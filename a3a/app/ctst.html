<p>Entered card testing mode.</p>

<p>Testing cards is very simple! Go to the card tab, sort by character, and decide a character to test cards for. Select a card, make sure the full image displays correctly, set the card to your page and test that the transparent image displays correctly and you hear the correct character voice. Then repeat these steps for each card of that character.</p>
